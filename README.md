Urban Building Classification dataset

## Introduction
We present a dataset for building detection and classification from very high-resolution satellite imagery with the focus on object-level interpretation of individual buildings.
It is meant to provide not only a flexible test platform for object detection algorithms but also a solid basis for the comparison of city morphologies and the investigation of urban planning.

The details of this dataset can be seen in paper 'Urban Building Classification (UBC) â€“ A Dataset for Individual Building Detection and Classification from Satellite Imagery' (Link will be added after the publication).

Here is an example of the annotation.

Input image (a), building footprints (b, green polygons), roof types (c) and functions (d, coarse classes)

## Download
Currently, we only provide the standard [COCO](https://cocodataset.org/#home) instance segmentation format.

Annotations of roof coarse, roof fine and use coarse are build.
